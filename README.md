# Google-Meet-PATTATT
A Firefox extension to add push-to-talk functionality to Google Meet

## What is this?
Push-to-talk allows the user to control the microphone with the spacebar. To talk, press and _hold_ the spacebar; when done talking, release the spacebar.

"PATTATT" is a gross mispronounciation of "PTT", which is short for push-to-talk
